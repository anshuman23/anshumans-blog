I'm a senior Electrical Engineering undergraduate at the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi. Programming is what gets me going and research is what sustains it. My utlimate goal is to obtain a PhD in computer science, get into academia and be the best at what I do. Which is mostly computer networks, systems and machine learning. This blog is my attempt at helping people learn more about most things that I __think__ I am good at. Stay tuned for some interesting stuff.

I really enjoy solving technical problems so if you have any (related to the blog or even otherwise), please don't hesitate to contact me!  

Best,
Anshuman.
