I am incoming Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis. I am currently working on [Tensorflex](https://github.com/anshuman23/tensorflex) as part of Google Summer of Code.

To check out my list of publications, my CV and all the other gory details, visit my website [here](https://anshuman23.github.io)

I really enjoy solving technical problems so if you have any (related to the blog or even otherwise), please don't hesitate to contact me!
