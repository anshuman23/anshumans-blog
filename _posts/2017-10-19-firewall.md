Hello there! Today we're going to see how to implement a Layer-2 SDN Firewall using the POX Controller and Mininet. We are also going to reuse the same *Tree* topology we created last time (albeit with some minor changes). In case you are new to Mininet, you are highly recommended to first go through the previous blog post on using Mininet, [here](http://www.anshuman.ml/networks/2017/10/15/mininet/)

Here is what you're going to learn today - 
- How to use the Python based POX OpenFlow controller instead of the default Mininet Controller 
- Understand what an SDN based Firewall does and implement it from scratch using POX

## Software Prerequisites
- **Mininet**: While you can use the Mininet VM like last time, I recommend installing the package if you're on Linux. For Ubuntu, just run:
`sudo apt-get install mininet` in terminal and you're good to go.
- **POX**: For the POX controller you just need to clone the git repository. I'm assuming you have git installed and know how to work it. If this is not the case, [this](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is a good resource. To clone the repository type the following in terminal and hit enter:
`git clone https://github.com/noxrepo/pox`

## SDN Firewall
A Firewall can be understood to be something that obstructs traffic coming its way and filters it according to some *rules*. A general Firewall can be employed to protect a network from the internet. For an SDN based Firewall, we are going to use the OpenFlow controller to filter traffic between hosts according to some rules and accordingly let it pass through or not.
The way we will do this is by using the POX controller to establish our required *policies* or *rules* (we will come to these later) and filter traffic between hosts using the switches.
An example of such an SDN Firewall with two hosts is shown in the figure below:
