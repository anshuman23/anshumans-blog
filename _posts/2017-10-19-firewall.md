Hello there! Today we're going to see how to implement a Layer-2 SDN Firewall using the POX Controller and Mininet. We are also going to reuse the same *Tree* topology we created last time (albeit with some minor changes). In case you are new to Mininet, you are highly recommended to first go through the previous blog post on using Mininet, [here](http://www.anshuman.ml/networks/2017/10/15/mininet/)

Here is what you're going to learn today - 
- How to use the Python based POX OpenFlow controller instead of the default Mininet Controller 
- Understand what an SDN based Firewall does and implement it from scratch using POX

## Software Prerequisites
- **Mininet**: While you can use the Mininet VM like last time, I recommend installing the package if you're on Linux. For Ubuntu, just run:
`sudo apt-get install mininet` in terminal and you're good to go.
- **POX**: For the POX controller you just need to clone the git repository. I'm assuming you have git installed and know how to work it. If this is not the case, [this](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is a good resource. To clone the repository type the following in terminal and hit enter:
`git clone https://github.com/noxrepo/pox`
