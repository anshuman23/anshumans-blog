Hello there! Today we're going to see how to implement a Layer-2 SDN Firewall using the POX Controller and Mininet. We are also going to reuse the same *Tree* topology we created last time (albeit with some minor changes). In case you are new to Mininet, you are highly recommended to first go through the previous blog post on using Mininet, [here](http://www.anshuman.ml/networks/2017/10/15/mininet/)

Here is what you're going to learn today - 
- How to use the Python based POX OpenFlow controller instead of the default Mininet Controller 
- Understand what an SDN based Firewall does and implement it from scratch using POX
