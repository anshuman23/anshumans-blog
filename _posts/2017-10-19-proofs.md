Hello there! I recently came across Proof Assistants and was really intrigued by them. While these do not hold mainstream attention as of now, most proof assistants are being used to help solve various research problems in mathematics and computer science. Due to their appreciable benefits, I decided to write this post to lightly touch upon two of them - Coq and Isabelle. Finally, we will be writing a very simple proof in both the languages to see them in action.  

## What are Proof Assistants?
Proof Assistants are software that allow you to translate mathematical proofs into formal proofs which can be then verified by a computer. Therefore, their work extends towards verification of mathematical theorems and an attempt to *formalize* mathematics. As these proof assistants have compilers which read and accept only a particular style of inputs given to them, it could be argued that they are *programming languages*.

## Coq & Isabelle
Coq and Isabelle are examples of proof assistants. Without making this explanation too complicated (since I am no expert myself), Coq uses a set of languages (which we will come to later) to understand a proof and verify it. The idea behind Coq and even Isabelle is to be able to break the proof down into some subgoals that each has to be proved. As a result, if each of these subgoals is proved, the end result is that the proof has been verified.

### Installing Coq
I'm assuming you are using some form of Linux, otherwise you may head over [here](http://coq.inria.fr/download) to download it.
- On Ubuntu, running `sudo apt-get install coq` will take care of everything

### Installing Isabelle
Again, if you're not using Linux, head over [here](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/installation.html).
- First run `wget https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2017_app.tar.gz`
- Then, `tar -xzf Isabelle2017_app.tar.gz`
- To start up the IDE, run `Isabelle2017/Isabelle2017`. It will take some time to start up the first time!

## Basics of Coq
It would be a good idea to get an understanding of how Coq works. There are three types of language sets that Coq uses to verify proofs:
- `Gallina`: This is used to write down what needs to be proved.
- `Tactics`: This aids the writing of the proofs and the commands are always lower-case.
- `Vernacular`: This part of Coq handles definitions and they keywords used always start with an upper-case letter.

It is also important to note that in Coq every statement ends with a `.` just like the `;` is used to terminate statements in `C/C++`.

### A general reference for Tactics
This is just a list of very few tactics employed by Coq with some simple explanations behind their functions. Don't worry if you don't understand any of these now-- It's just to get an idea of what tactics look like and their functions.


Tactic | Function
------------ | -------------
*intros* | Introduce terms into the proof
*simpl* | Simplifies the subgoal
*destruct* | Destructs the current term into subgoals
*induction* | Destructs the current term by adding a predefined inductive hypothesis 
*rewrite* | Rewrites one subgoal with another
*reflexivity* | Solves a subgoal where LHS = RHS
*assumption* | Solves the subgoal if a defined hypothesis exists
*contradiction* | Solves the subgoal if a contradictory hypothesis (not an equality) exists

### A general reference for Vernacular commands


Command | Function
------------ | -------------
*Theorem* | Starts the theorem and is followed by the theorem name
*Lemma* | Same as *Theorem*
*Remark* | Same as *Theorem*
*Fact* | Same as *Theorem*
*Corollary* | Same as *Theorem*
*Proposition* | Same as *Theorem*
*Qed* | Hence, proved

## Basics of Isabelle
While by no means have we studied Coq in-depth, Isabelle is an even tougher nut to crack. I will describe the core syntax of an Isabelle proof below and then to completely understand everything we will directly see the Isabelle proof for the theorem we seek to prove today. Again, do not panic if you don't understand anything. These are more of a reference than anything else.

### Core syntax

proof | **proof** *method* statement **qed** 
proof (contd.) | **by** method
method | *(simp . . .)* or *(blast . . .)* or *(rule . . .)*
statement | **fix** variables (^) 
statement (contd.) | **assume** prop (=>)
statement (contd.) | **from** *fact* (**have**-**show**) prop proof 
statement (contd.) | **next** (separates subgoals) 
prop | *name* "formula"
fact | *name*  name-of-fact  "formula"

### Other important abbreviations

*this* | the previous proposition proved/assumed
*then* | from this
*thus* | then show
*hence* | then have

## The Theorem to prove
The theorem we seek to prove is really simple. It's the associativity of addition for natural numbers. What this translates into mathematically is (for A, B and C as natural numbers),

{% highlight python %}
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
{% endhighlight %}

I do not think this warrants much explanation, and we will jump into the proofs straight away.

## Proof in Isabelle

## Conclusion
With this post, I was hopefully able to interest you enough in the usefulness of proof assistants. Hopefully, you would like to learn more. There's some excellent Coq (and Isabelle) tutorials out there that you can look up if you're interested - [here](https://coq.inria.fr/tutorial-nahas), [here](http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs430/coq/pdf/Tutorial.pdf) and [here](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/tutorial.pdf). See you next time!
