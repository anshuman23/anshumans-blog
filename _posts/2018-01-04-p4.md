Hey there! I finally got time to write about P4Lang and what it seeks to accomplish and provide for the networking field. I hope you are as excited as I am!

## Goal for today
I am going to first tell you exactly what P4 is, the advantages that it brings to the networking hardware of the future and then move on to the programming to be done for today. The programming involves solving one of the __SIGCOMM 2017__ exercises and then running it as well. Since P4 is written on C/C++ backends, one would have to compile a lot of libraries from source and detailing the installation process would be both arduous as well as unnecessarily lengthy for an introductory blog post. Hence, we will use the _p4app_ tool to circumvent this problem (It uses Docker!). It is also important to understand that this is a super-fast introduction in _relative_ terms: It might still be considered lengthy but will probably be the _fastest_ introduction anyone has ever given to P4lang, including the programming aspect of it.

### What is P4 and what does it do?
In very simple words, P4 allows a network engineer to program how switches process packets. Currently, if you want some special features for your router, you would talk to your vendor to be able to get them in the next version. Hence, every time you require a new feature the hardware needs to be changed to support it. P4 wishes to eliminate all of that. It is a Domain Specific Language that seeks to incorporate general programmability into routers and switches so that if you want new functionality in your device you can just program it. Most hardware doesn't support P4 yet, but Barefoot Networks and a lot of major players in the networking field are working towards this making this P4 supported hardware a reality. Barefoot Networks recently came out with _Tofino_, which is the world's first end-user programmable Ethernet switch. I am optimistic that very soon the entire industry would be using hardware that can fully utilize the power of a programmable forwarding dataplane.

### Installation and set-up

###### p4app
We are just required to install and configure _p4app_. The installation is a very simple process and can be undertaken by following the steps below:
- Make sure you have `docker` on your machine 
- Clone the _p4app_ github repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/p4lang/p4app`
- `cd` into the repo by typing `cd p4app`
- To get everything up and running simply run one of their examples. This can be done by the following command: `sudo ./p4app examples/simple_router.p4app` 

For the rest of the set-up we need to take care of a few things. Also running P4 apps and everything else on how and what we need to run p4app, will be covered in the next section. For now, we are concerned with how to just set everything up.

So the SIGCOMM exercise requires the use of certain scripts by the Mininet hosts. For that we will require a script of some sort that can transfer the files into the Docker container on it's own every time. I have written a script that does this called `script.py`. You could write your own interpretation for doing this or just use my code. Here is `script.py`:
{% highlight python %}

import re
import os

output = os.popen('sudo docker ps -a| grep "p4app_"').read()

re1='.*?'
re2='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re3='.*?'
re4='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re5='.*?'
re6='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re7='.*?'
re8='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re9='.*?'
re10='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re11='.*?'
re12='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re13='.*?'
re14='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re15='.*?'
re16='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re17='.*?'
re18='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re19='.*?'
re20='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re21='.*?'
re22='(?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)'
re23='.*?'
re24='((?:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*))'


container_name = ''

rg = re.compile(re1+re2+re3+re4+re5+re6+re7+re8+re9+re10+re11+re12+re13+re14+re15+re16+re17+re18+re19+re20+re21+re22+re23+re24,re.IGNORECASE|re.DOTALL)
m = rg.search(output)
if m:
    container_name = str(m.group(1))

else:
    print "[ERROR] Run this script only after you have run the p4app for scrambler.p4app"

os.system('sudo docker cp docker/scripts/send.py ' + container_name + '://scripts/') 
os.system('sudo docker cp docker/scripts/receive.py ' + container_name + '://scripts/')

print "[INFO] Operation successfull"

{% endhighlight %}

The code is fairly straightforward. I am first issuing the command `sudo docker ps -a | grep "p4app_"`. The output of this command would look something like this:
```
77a6c735246a        p4lang/p4app:latest   "./p4apprunner.py"   8 days ago          Exited (0) 8 days ago                                                      p4app_123456451
```

The last column here refers to the container name. We need this to be able to perform any actions on it. So I use simple regular expression matching (again, you could create something that suits you better) and find this out. Then I finally execute the `cp` (copy) command on the docker container and ensure that the scripts are copied in the `scripts` directory in the container.

Now that we have this ready, just place `script.py` in the `p4app` directory.

After this is done create a `scrambler.p4app` empty directory in the `p4app` directory. Then we need to create a custom controller for Mininet BMV2 (P4 Behavioural Model 2) that can allow us to have custom tables and a custom control plane (required for the SIGCOMM exercise). Currently _p4app_ forces these things to certain defaults. To do this, go to `p4app/docker/scripts/mininet/` in the `p4app` directory and copy over the `appcontroller.py` and `shortestpath.py` files over to the newly created `scrambler.p4app` directory.

We will only be changing the `appcontroller.py` file. The following steps need to be performed:

-  Rename `appcontroller.py` to `mycontroller.py`
- Open `mycontroller.py` and in there change the name of the `class` from `AppController` to `CustomAppController`
- Then finally find the `generateDefaultCommands()` function and comment out everything present in it. Do not comment out the function, but just it's content. It should look like this:

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/owler-image/logo/barefoot-networks_owler_20160302_073707_original.jpg)
</div>

We are done with all the set-up. Now what is remaining is to solve the Scrambler exercise and then run it as a `p4app`. To solve the exercise first go to this relevant starting code [here](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/tree/master/SIGCOMM_2017/exercises/scrambler). Go through the `README` once as well. The problem is fairly simple-- we need to "flip" the Ipv4 and Ethernet addresses as they have been scrambled/flipped by the control plane. Flipping essentially translates to taking the one's complement. Therefore we can just use the one's complement operator of C/C++ `~` to flip the addresses. I am first going to post the entire `scrambler.p4` file with the solution here and then briefly explain parts of the code. Here is the solved `scrambler.p4`:

The first section of the code labeled `/*************************************************************************

*************************************************************************/` is



Hello all! Firstly, I would like to apologize for this rather extended gap between posts. I have been busy with applications for graduate study and internships as part of the current curriculum. 

Getting down to business. Today we'll be looking at something interesting-- how to build our own voice command recognition system. This will entail:
1. Speak to your laptop to activate the agent
2. Only certain commands will activate the agent
3. When these commands are recognized, the agent can execute certain actions (This won't be covered here for obvious reasons-- feel free to create whatever you would like using these!)

The really good thing about what we're going to do today is that the reliance on external libraries is going to be minimal and is not going to require long and arduous code writing. At the end of it, we'll have a program capable of performing a seemingly complex task with supremely simple code (written in Python!).

### Installation
To install pocketsphinx on Ubuntu, just run the following in terminal:
```
sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx
```
That's all there is!

### Deciding on the voice commands
We are going to have our program recognize the following commands:

- __HELLO__ : Example Usage: Saying __HELLO__ should generate a random templated response from a response list
- __DATE__ : Example Usage: Saying __DATE__ should give you the current system datetime
- __GOODBYE__ : Example Usage: Saying __GOODBYE__ should quit the program
- __NAME__ : Example Usage: Saying __NAME__ should display your name
- __SNAKE__ : Example Usage: Saying __SNAKE__ should start a game-- a Python program named `snake.py` 

However, for our implementation and for the purpose of instruction, we are just going to print the command every time it is recognized. This is to signify that our implementation is working. As an exercise, one could actually extend this to meet the example usage.

Also, feel free to have your own commands here. Now for Sphinx to recognize these commands internally, we are required to create a dictionary and a language model specifying them in a particular way. For this, we will use the [CMU Lexicon Tool](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html). 

### Generating the Language Model & Dictionary

Doing this is very simple. Just create a `words.txt` file with the following data:
```
HELLO
DATE
GOODBYE
NAME
SNAKE
```

Upload this file to the [CMU Lexicon Tool](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html) webpage. Download the `.dic` and `.lm` files from all the ones generated. In the current directory, place the `.dic` file in a directory called `dic` and the `.lm` file in a directory called `lm`.
The `2698.lm` (for me, this is the name-- it will be different for you), looks like this:
```
Language model created by QuickLM on Tue Jan  2 12:55:32 EST 2018
Copyright (c) 1996-2010 Carnegie Mellon University and Alexander I. Rudnicky

The model is in standard ARPA format, designed by Doug Paul while he was at MITRE.

The code that was used to produce this language model is available in Open Source.
Please visit http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/ for more information

The (fixed) discount mass is 0.5. The backoffs are computed using the ratio method.
This model based on a corpus of 5 sentences and 7 words

\data\
ngram 1=7
ngram 2=10
ngram 3=5

-1.4771 GOODBYE -0.2218
-1.4771 HELLO -0.2218
-1.4771 NAME -0.2218
-1.4771 SNAKE -0.2218

-0.3010 NAME </s> -0.3010
-0.3010 SNAKE </s> -0.3010

\3-grams:
-0.3010 <s> DATE </s>
-0.3010 <s> GOODBYE </s>
-0.3010 <s> HELLO </s>
-0.3010 <s> NAME </s>
-0.3010 <s> SNAKE </s>

\end\
```

The dict file `2698.dic` looks like this:
```
DATE	D EY T
GOODBYE	G UH D B AY
HELLO	HH AH L OW
HELLO(2)	HH EH L OW
NAME	N EY M
SNAKE	S N EY K
```

We also need a pre-trained English model and we will be using the `en-us` model provided by CMU Sphinx itself. Download all the files present [here](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinx4/tree/master/sphinx4-data/src/main/resources/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us/en-us) from Github and place them in the current directory in a folder `en-us` inside a folder called `model`. So in the current directory along with the `dic` and `lm` directories we now also have `model/en-us/` containing all the files previously downloaded from Github.

The `model/en-us` directory will contain the following files:
```
feat.params
mdef
means
noisedict
README
sendump
transition_matrices
variances
```

### Coding the voice assistant in Python

We first start off with our module imports:
{% highlight python %}
import os
import re
from subprocess import Popen
from time import sleep
{% endhighlight %}

Next we will add the locations of our dictionary and language model to our program:
{% highlight python %}
DIR_PATH = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
DIC_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/dic/2698.dic"
LM_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/lm/2698.lm"
MODEL_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/model/en-us"
TEMP_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/temp/output.log"
{% endhighlight %}

The temp path is for the log directory from where we will read what the pocketsphinx is saying. So make sure that you have read/write access in this directory.

Now the way we would start this from the command line would comprise of a command like this - 
```
pocketsphinx_continuous -inmic yes -dict ~/speech-rec/dic/2698.dic -lm ~/speech-rec/lm/2698.lm -hmm ~/speech-rec/model/en-us/ -logfn ~/speech-rec/temp/output.log -backtrace yes
```
Assuming the name of my directory where I am writing all this is called `speech-rec`.
So we will use the subprocess module to execute this program in Python. Firstly, we create a string specifying this command for simplicity:

{% highlight python %}

launchSphinx = "pocketsphinx_continuous " + "-inmic yes " + "-dict " + DIC_PATH + " -lm " + LM_PATH + " -hmm " + MODEL_PATH + " -logfn " + TEMP_PATH + " -backtrace yes"

{% endhighlight %}

Next,we need to have a function that will check for what command was recognized. If you run the pocketsphinx command in the terminal (without the `logfn` flag) you'll see that in one of the [INFO] statements we see the output of the model. As an example, this is how this statement looks:
```
INFO: pocketsphinx.c(1180): HELLO (-7143)
```

To get to this we'll use regex. You could also use grep on the log output document or just an old fashioned search on the same. This is completely up to you. My implementation for this regex based search is shown below in the form of the function `check`. You can create your own or reuse this.

{% highlight python %}
def check(input):
    output = ''
    a='((?:[a-z][a-z]+))'
    b='.*?'
    c='((?:[a-z][a-z]+))'
    d='.*?'
    e='((?:[a-z][a-z]+))'
                                
    regex = re.compile(a+b+c+d+e,re.IGNORECASE|re.DOTALL)
    match = regex.search(input)
    if match:
        if match.group(1) == 'INFO' and match.group(2) == 'pocketsphinx':
            output=match.group(3)
        else:
            output="n/a"
    else:
        output="n/a"
    return str(output)

{% endhighlight %}

Next we use the `Popen` function of the `subprocess` module to run the command in another terminal. Moreover, all of this has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and won't possibly work on another OS. After this we give a small delay for the logs to start being created and so that they get some relevant data. Here goes:
{% highlight python %}
proc = Popen("gnome-terminal -e '" + launchSphinx + "'", shell = True)
sleep(5)
{% endhighlight %}

 Next we keep reading the log file, running our `check` function and printing the output, all inside an infinite loop. One more thing to keep in mind-- we need to maintain an index checkpoint so that we don't read previously written commands to file but always start from where we last were. This is important to implement because the logs are continuously being written to by pocketsphinx and that too, in a non-destructive manner. This checkpoint control will be ensured using the `idx` variable. Moreover, we will terminate the created child processes at the end of the program.
 
{% highlight python %} 
idx = 0 

while True:
    with open(TEMP_PATH) as f:
        for i, line in enumerate(f):
            if line.startswith("INFO: pocketsphinx.c") and (i>idx):
                cmd = check(line)
                print cmd
        idx = i
            
proc.terminate()
proc.kill()
{% endhighlight %}

One more thing to remember, since we have not implemented a clean-up mechanism for the `output.log`, you will have to currently delete it everytime you run the command. As a good clean-up mechanism we can tie the __GOODBYE__ command to delete both the `output.log` file as well as exit the program. This would look like this:

{% highlight python %} 
idx = 0 
flag = 0
while True:
    with open(TEMP_PATH) as f:
        for i, line in enumerate(f):
            if line.startswith("INFO: pocketsphinx.c") and (i>idx):
                cmd = check(line)
                print cmd
                if cmd == 'GOODBYE':
                    os.system('rm -rf ' + TEMP_PATH)
                    flag = 1
                    break
        idx = i
        if flag == 1:
            break
    if flag == 1:
        break
            
proc.terminate()
proc.kill()
{% endhighlight %}

This does the trick!

This is the complete program that we have written so far:
{% highlight python %} 
import os
import re
from subprocess import Popen
from time import sleep

DIR_PATH = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
DIC_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/dic/2698.dic"
LM_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/lm/2698.lm"
MODEL_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/model/en-us"
TEMP_PATH = DIR_PATH + "/temp/output.log"

launchSphinx = "pocketsphinx_continuous " + "-inmic yes " + "-dict " + DIC_PATH + " -lm " + LM_PATH + " -hmm " + MODEL_PATH + " -logfn " + TEMP_PATH + " -backtrace yes"

def check(input):
    output = ''
    a='((?:[a-z][a-z]+))'
    b='.*?'
